# About
This repository contains analysis of various software metrics across different versions (5.11.4, 5.12.0, 5.12.1) of a software system (Junit). The project uses Python and Jupyter notebooks to process metric data and generate summaries for metrics such as Essential Complexity, Class Coupling, Class Derivation, Method Count, and Lines of Code. 

Results are presented in both CSV and Excel formats for comparative analysis.
